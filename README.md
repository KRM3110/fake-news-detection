# fake-news-detection
It is fake news detection using Machine learning algorithms
Overview
This project aims to detect fake news from various sources in both English and Hindi languages using Machine Learning techniques. 
Fake news can spread misinformation and have serious implications for society, so it is essential to develop reliable methods to 
identify and combat them. The project leverages ML models to classify news articles as either fake or real based on certain features.

Dataset
The project uses curated datasets of labeled news articles, including both fake and real news, in both English and Hindi languages. 
The datasets are collected from various reliable sources and are split into training and testing subsets.

Model Building
The project uses several machine learning models for fake news detection, including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Separate models are trained for both English and Hindi datasets. The models are trained on the training subsets and evaluated 
on the testing subsets to choose the best-performing models for each language.

Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion 
matrix, for both English and Hindi languages.
